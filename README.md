1. Project Title
Predictive Analytics for Customer Churn in a Subscription-based Business

2. Project Overview
Problem Statement: Customer churn is a critical issue in subscription-based businesses. Retaining customers is far less expensive than acquiring new ones, so predicting churn can help businesses proactively reduce churn rates and improve customer satisfaction.
Solution: This project uses data analytics and machine learning to predict customer churn and provides actionable insights to retain customers.

3. Objectives
Data Collection: Gather and preprocess the customer data from a subscription-based business.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understand customer behavior, identify trends, and key factors contributing to churn.
Feature Engineering: Create meaningful features from the dataset to improve model performance.
Model Building: Train and evaluate multiple machine learning models to predict customer churn.
Model Evaluation: Assess the model performance using appropriate metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Actionable Insights: Provide recommendations to the business for reducing churn based on data analysis.

4. Data Sources
Dataset: The project uses a publicly available dataset, Telco Customer Churn Dataset, from Kaggle. This dataset contains customer information, subscription details, and whether or not they churned.

5. Tools and Libraries
Python: For data analysis and building machine learning models.
Libraries:
pandas for data manipulation.
NumPy for numerical operations.
matplotlib and seaborn for data visualization.
scikit-learn for machine learning.
XGBoost for gradient boosting.
Other relevant libraries like LabelEncoder, StandardScaler.

6. Project Workflow
6.1 Data Collection and Preprocessing
Load the Dataset: Load the Telco Customer Churn dataset using pandas.
Handle Missing Values: Drop rows with missing values or apply appropriate imputation.
Encoding and Scaling:
Categorical Encoding: Convert categorical variables such as "Gender" and "Churn" into numeric formats using LabelEncoder.
Feature Scaling: Scale numerical variables like "Tenure", "MonthlyCharges", and "TotalCharges" using StandardScaler to bring them to a comparable range.
Code Example:
python
Copy code
df.dropna(inplace=True)
df['Gender'] = label_enc.fit_transform(df['Gender'])
df['Churn'] = label_enc.fit_transform(df['Churn'])
df[['Tenure', 'MonthlyCharges', 'TotalCharges']] = scaler.fit_transform(df[['Tenure', 'MonthlyCharges', 'TotalCharges']])


6.2 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Churn Distribution: Visualize the distribution of churned vs non-churned customers.
Correlation Analysis: Understand how features correlate with churn using a heatmap.
Data Visualization: Use histograms, box plots, and scatter plots to explore relationships.
The distribution of churn and non-churn customers is visualised below. The plot shows that 26.6% of the customers churned.

The heatmap below reveals strong correlations between "Tenure" and "Churn", and moderate correlations between "Monthly Charges" and "Churn."

Code Example:
python code
sns.countplot(x='Churn', data=df)
sns.heatmap(df.corr(), annot=True)



6.3 Feature Engineering
Feature Importance: Identify key features that impact churn using models like Random Forest. This helps in understanding which variables (such as tenure, monthly charges) are significant.
Feature Selection: Remove irrelevant features and select only the most important ones.
Code Example:
python code
	def distplot(feature, frame, color='r'):
    plt.figure(figsize=(8,3))
    plt.title("Distribution for {}".format(feature))
    ax = sns.distplot(frame[feature], color= color)



6.4 Model Building
Split Data: Split the dataset into training and testing sets using train_test_split.
Model Training: Train various machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, RandomForest, and XGBoost to predict customer churn.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
Code Example:
python
Copy code
xgb_model = XGBClassifier()
xgb_model.fit(X_train, y_train)
y_pred = xgb_model.predict(X_test)
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))


6.5 Model Evaluation
Cross-Validation: Perform k-fold cross-validation to ensure the model is not overfitting.
ROC Curve: Plot the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve to evaluate how well the model distinguishes between classes.
Confusion Matrix: Analyze the modelâ€™s performance by examining false positives and false negatives.
Code Example:
python code
y_pred_prob = lr_model.predict_proba(X_test)[:,1]
fpr, tpr, thresholds = roc_curve(y_test, y_pred_prob)
plt.plot([0, 1], [0, 1], 'k--' )
plt.plot(fpr, tpr, label='Logistic Regression',color = "r")
plt.xlabel('False Positive Rate')
plt.ylabel('True Positive Rate')
plt.title('Logistic Regression ROC Curve',fontsize=16)
plt.show();




6.6 Actionable Insights
Feature Importance: Analyze the most important features contributing to customer churn, such as "Tenure" and "Monthly Charges".
Recommendations:
Improve Customer Experience: Focus on customers with high tenure and monthly charges who are more likely to churn.
Offer Discounts: Offer personalized promotions to retain customers predicted to churn.
Loyalty Programs: Implement loyalty programs for customers with high monthly charges.
